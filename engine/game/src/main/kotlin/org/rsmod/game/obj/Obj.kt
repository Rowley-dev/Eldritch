/**
 * Represents an obj that exists on the game map at specific coordinates.
 *
 * Objs have different visibility scopes and ownership properties that determine which players can
 * see and interact with them.
 *
 * **Creation**: The primary constructor is reserved for **internal engine usage**. Instead, use the
 * appropriate companion object helper functions depending on your scenario:
 * - [fromPvp] - For objs dropped from player vs. player combat.
 * - [fromPvn] - For objs dropped from player vs. npc combat.
 * - [fromOwner] - For objs dropped by or for a specific player.
 * - [fromServer] - For server-spawned objs that should be instantly visible to everyone.
 *
 * **Visibility and Ownership**:
 * - [receiverId] determines who can currently see the obj.
 * - [ownerId] tracks the original owner (important for ironman restrictions).
 * - Objs can be private (visible to specific players) or public (visible to all)
 *
 * _Note: The aforementioned ids make use of [Player.observerUUID], which takes group game modes
 * into account._
